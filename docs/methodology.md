# Methodology

This project was developed using **NotebookLM** as the primary Generative AI tool.

The methodology followed these steps:

1. Selection of a financial education theme focused on personal financial planning.
2. Curation of open and reliable sources, including articles and educational YouTube videos.
3. Ingestion of the selected sources into NotebookLM to ground AI responses.
4. Definition of study objectives and strategic questions.
5. Testing of multiple prompt variations for the same questions, adjusting tone, complexity, and format.
6. Analysis of AI-generated responses based on clarity, usefulness, and alignment with the sources.
7. Organization of the outputs into summaries, a glossary, and a final study guide.

The emphasis of the methodology is on **critical and intentional use of Generative AI**, avoiding generic answers and prioritizing source-based learning.
