## 📌 Project Overview

One of the featured projects focuses on building a **thematic study guide using NotebookLM**, centered on **personal financial planning**. The study covers fundamental concepts such as:

- Personal financial organization
- Expense tracking and spending control
- Monthly budgeting
- Emergency fund planning
- Financial goal setting (short, medium, and long term)

Curated open sources (text and video) were used to ground the AI responses and ensure reliable, reference-based learning.

## 🤖 Use of Generative AI

Generative AI was applied to:
- Summarize and organize financial education content
- Generate structured explanations based on provided sources
- Test different prompt variations for the same questions
- Build a glossary of key financial concepts
- Create reusable prompts for future study and revision

The project emphasizes **critical use of AI**, avoiding generic outputs and focusing on source-based reasoning.
